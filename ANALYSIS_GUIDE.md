# Analysis Guide: What Insights to Extract

## Overview

This guide explains what analysis you should focus on and why it matters for improving Conecta.

---

## 1. Hallucination Analysis (PRIORITY #1)

### What to Look For

**Hallucination Rate:**
```
Current: 35% (7/20 conversations)
  - Minor: 71.4% (5 cases)
  - Major: 28.6% (2 cases)
```

**Critical Question:** Is 35% acceptable?
- ‚ùå **NO** if: >10% are major/critical severity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **CONCERNING** if: 20-35% with mostly minor
- ‚úÖ **ACCEPTABLE** if: <20% and all minor

### Root Cause: Documents Have Answer (71%)

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT finding!**

```
71.4% of hallucinations happen DESPITE having the answer in documents
```

**What this means:**
- ‚ùå NOT a retrieval problem (documents contain the answer)
- ‚úÖ It's a **grounding problem** (Conecta not using available info)

**Action Items:**
1. **Improve prompts** to enforce strict grounding
2. **Add retrieval validation** before generating response
3. **Implement citation requirement** (force Conecta to cite sources)
4. **Consider RAG improvements** (chunk size, retrieval strategy)

### Hallucination Triggers

**Patterns found:**

| Factor | Hallucination Cases | Clean Cases | Difference |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Avg doc length | 2,384 chars | 3,440 chars | -31% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Num documents | 1.7 docs | 2.2 docs | -23% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Question length | 10.1 words | 8.3 words | +22% ‚ö†Ô∏è |

**Interpretation:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Sparse context** (fewer/shorter documents) ‚Üí More hallucinations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Complex questions** (longer) ‚Üí More hallucinations
- ‚úÖ **Response length** doesn't matter (similar)

**Action Items:**
1. **Threshold alerts:** Flag conversations with <2 documents or <2,000 chars
2. **Question complexity detection:** Ask for clarification on long questions
3. **Context expansion:** Retrieve more documents for complex queries

---

## 2. Follow-Up Question Analysis (PRIORITY #2)

### What to Look For

**Multi-turn vs Single-turn:**
```python
Single-turn hallucination rate: X%
Multi-turn hallucination rate: Y%
```

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Follow-ups Improve Quality (Y < X - 10%)**
```
‚úÖ Follow-ups reduce hallucinations by >10%
‚Üí Clarification questions WORK
‚Üí ACTION: Encourage multi-turn conversations
‚Üí Implement: "Need more info?" prompt after first response
```

**Scenario B: Follow-ups Hurt Quality (Y > X + 10%)**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Follow-ups INCREASE hallucinations by >10%
‚Üí Multi-turn introduces confusion
‚Üí ACTION: Discourage follow-ups, encourage single comprehensive question
‚Üí Implement: Better initial prompts, examples
```

**Scenario C: No Difference (|Y - X| < 10%)**
```
üìç Follow-ups neither help nor hurt
‚Üí Neutral impact
‚Üí ACTION: No changes needed for multi-turn
```

### Clarification Effectiveness

**Short follow-ups (<7 words):**
These likely indicate user responding to Conecta's clarification:
- "tarjeta de credito" (specifying product)
- "en bogota" (specifying location)

**What to measure:**
```python
Short followup hallucination rate: A%
Normal followup hallucination rate: B%
First turn hallucination rate: C%
```

**If A < B and A < C:**
```
‚úÖ Clarification questions work!
‚Üí Conecta successfully gets needed context
‚Üí ACTION: Make Conecta more proactive in asking clarification
```

**If A >= B or A >= C:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Clarification doesn't help
‚Üí Either: Users don't provide useful clarification
‚Üí Or: Conecta asks wrong questions
‚Üí ACTION: Improve clarification question quality
```

## 3. Blame Analysis (PRIORITY #3)

### What to Look For

**Blame Distribution:**
```
Conecta's fault: X%
User's fault: Y%
Both: Z%
Neither (success): W%
```

### Decision Tree

**If Conecta >60% responsible:**
```
ü§ñ CONECTA IS THE PROBLEM

Focus areas:
1. Hallucination reduction (grounding)
2. Completeness improvements (use all available info)
3. Better clarification questions

Technical fixes:
- Stricter system prompts
- Citation requirements
- Answer validation before sending
- RAG improvements

Timeline: 2-4 weeks for implementation
```

**If User >60% responsible:**
```
üë§ USER QUESTIONS ARE THE PROBLEM

Focus areas:
1. Improve question quality
2. Provide examples
3. Better UI/UX guidance

UI/UX fixes:
- "Example questions" section
- Input validation (warn on vague questions)
- Suggested question reformulations
- Topic dropdown (vs free text)

Timeline: 1-2 weeks for UI updates
```

**If Balanced (40-60% each):**
```
‚öñÔ∏è  DUAL PROBLEM

Parallel tracks:
1. Improve Conecta (grounding, completeness)
2. Improve UX (question quality)

Priority:
- Track 1: Conecta improvements (higher impact)
- Track 2: UX improvements (faster to implement)

Timeline: 3-5 weeks for both
```

### Specific Blame Categories

**Conecta's Fault Examples:**
```
Issue: Hallucination despite having answer
Count: X cases
Action: Implement stricter grounding

Issue: Incomplete answer with available info
Count: Y cases
Action: Enforce "use all relevant info" prompt rule

Issue: Unnecessary clarification request
Count: Z cases
Action: Improve clarification trigger logic
```

**User's Fault Examples:**
```
Issue: Vague questions leading to irrelevant docs
Count: X cases
Action: Show examples of good questions

Issue: Missing critical details
Count: Y cases
Action: Add mandatory fields (product type, location, etc.)
```

**Both at Fault Examples:**
```
Issue: Vague question + Conecta didn't ask clarification
Count: X cases
Action: Improve clarification trigger threshold

Issue: Vague question + Conecta hallucinated
Count: Y cases
Action: When docs are unclear, ALWAYS ask clarification
```

## 4. Actionable Insights Framework

### High-Impact Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)

**If hallucination rate >25%:**
```
1. Update system prompt:
   "NEVER make claims without document support"
   "If uncertain, say 'I don't have that information'"

2. Add validation step:
   Before sending response, check:
   - Does answer cite specific documents?
   - Are all claims supported?

3. Implement threshold alerts:
   - Flag responses with <2 documents
   - Flag responses >300 words without citations
```

**If user questions are vague:**
```
1. Update UI:
   - Add example questions section
   - Show "Good question" vs "Vague question" examples

2. Add validation:
   - Warn users if question <5 words
   - Suggest: "Try adding: product type, location, specific details"

3. Pre-fill common scenarios:
   - "How to..." dropdown
   - "I need help with [product] about [topic]"
```

### Medium-Impact Improvements (3-4 weeks)

**RAG Improvements:**
```
1. Retrieval strategy:
   - Current: Top-K documents
   - Proposed: MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) for diversity

2. Context expansion:
   - If query is complex (>10 words), retrieve more docs
   - If first retrieval has low relevance, try rewrite query

3. Document preprocessing:
   - Better chunking strategy
   - Overlapping chunks for context
```

**Multi-Agent Validation:**
```
1. Pre-response check:
   Agent 1: "Does this response hallucinate?"
   Agent 2: "Is this response complete?"
   If either fails ‚Üí reject, retry

2. Post-response verification:
   Agent 3: "Cite specific documents for each claim"
   If can't cite ‚Üí flag for review
```

### Long-Term Improvements (2-3 months)

**Fine-tuning:**
```
1. Collect validated conversations (human review)
2. Fine-tune model on:
   - Good grounding examples
   - Proper clarification questions
   - Complete answers

3. A/B test:
   - Base model vs fine-tuned
   - Measure hallucination rate difference
```

**Reinforcement Learning:**
```
1. Reward model:
   - +1 for grounded claims
   - -1 for hallucinations
   - +0.5 for asking clarification when needed

2. RLHF training:
   - Use human feedback on conversations
   - Optimize for reduced hallucinations
```

## Summary: What Matters Most

### For Hallucinations
1. ‚úÖ Rate (should be <15%)
2. ‚úÖ Severity (major/critical should be 0%)
3. ‚úÖ Root cause (docs have answer? retrieval? grounding?)

### For Follow-ups
1. ‚úÖ Do they help or hurt?
2. ‚úÖ Are clarifications effective?
3. ‚úÖ Should we encourage them?

### For Blame
1. ‚úÖ Who's responsible? (Conecta vs User)
2. ‚úÖ What specific issues?
3. ‚úÖ What's the priority fix?

### Action Plan
1. **Fix highest-impact issue first** (usually: hallucination grounding)
2. **Measure impact** (run analysis before/after)
3. **Iterate** (weekly improvements)
4. **Scale** (once <15% hallucination rate achieved)
